# Delivery Management System

## Overview
This project implements a Delivery Management System for a delivery company. The system manages delivery orders, tracks delivery details, and generates delivery notes for each transaction. It uses object-oriented programming in Python and is designed using UML diagrams.

## Features
- **Create Delivery Order:** Enter order details including recipient info, order numbers, and package details.
- **Manage Delivery Details:** Update delivery date, method, and package dimensions.
- **Generate Delivery Receipt:** Automatically produce a delivery note with all relevant information.
- **UML Diagrams:** Use-case and class diagrams to map out system design.
- **Object-Oriented Code:** Python classes with constructors, getters/setters, and display functions.

## UML Diagrams
- **Use-Case Diagram:** Identifies use-cases such as "Create Delivery Order", "Manage Delivery Details", and "Generate Delivery Receipt" with include and extend relationships.
- **Class Diagram:** Shows key classes such as DeliveryOrder, Recipient, Package, and Item with attributes and functions.

## Python Code
The project includes well-documented Python code that defines:
- **DeliveryOrder** class to hold order, delivery, and pricing information.
- **Recipient** class to store recipient details.
- **Package** class to capture package dimensions and weight.
- **Item** class to list items in an order.
Each class has constructors, setter/getter methods, and display functions. The code uses these objects to generate and print a delivery note.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the main Python file (e.g., `main.py`).
4. The delivery note will be displayed in the terminal.

## Summary of Learnings
In this project, I learned how to analyze real-world requirements and translate them into UML diagrams. I practiced writing clear, organized, and well-documented Python code using object-oriented principles. This assignment deepened my understanding of how to design and implement software that models real-world systems.
